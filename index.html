		    My work explores the relationship between Bauhausian sensibilities and midlife subcultures. With
		    influences as diverse as Munch and Roy Lichtenstein, new variations are generated from both
		    traditional and modern narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
		    Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the universe.
		    What starts out as vision soon becomes debased into a cacophony of defeat, leaving only a sense
		    of chaos and the possibility of a new synthesis.
        </p>
        <p>
		    As spatial replicas become reconfigured through diligent and personal practice, the viewer is
		    left with a hymn to the inaccuracies of our future.
